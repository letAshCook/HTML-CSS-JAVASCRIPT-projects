            <h2>How to use our website:</h2>
            <p>
                1. Our website will have a Nav-bar to navigate through different pages<br>
                2. The lessons will be in one page with videos and excercise for the respective chapter<br>
                3. There will also be a table of content and if you click on it, this will take you to the intended chapter<br>
                3. Finally there will be a quiz in the end

                   <span class="heading"><u>The first lesson that will be covered is Addition:</u></span><br>
                    Addition is a fundamental mathematical operation that involves combining 
                    two or more numbers to find their sum or total. It is one of the first mathematical 
                    concepts that children typically learn in primary school, and is essential for understanding 
                    more advanced mathematical concepts. Addition can be represented visually using objects like blocks or fingers,
                    or using symbols like numbers and mathematical notation. It is used in everyday life for tasks like counting money, 
                    measuring quantities, and solving basic word problems. In mathematics, addition is often used in conjunction with other 
                    operations like subtraction, multiplication, and division to solve more complex problems.

                    <span class="heading"><u>The second lesson that wil be covered is Subtraction:</u></span><br>
                    Subtraction is a fundamental mathematical operation that involves taking away one number 
                    from another to find the difference or the result of the operation. It is one of the core concepts
                    in mathematics and is usually introduced after addition. Subtraction can be represented visually using objects like blocks, 
                    or using symbols like numbers and mathematical notation. It is used in everyday life for tasks like calculating change, finding the 
                    difference between two quantities, and solving basic word problems. In mathematics, subtraction is often used in conjunction with other 
                    operations like addition, multiplication, and division to solve more complex problems. It is an essential skill for developing mathematical 
                    reasoning and problem-solving abilities.

                    <span class="heading"><u>The third lesson that wil be covered is multiplication:</u></span><br>
                    Multiplication is a fundamental mathematical operation that involves combining two or more numbers 
                    to find their product or the result of the operation. It is one of the basic arithmetic operations and 
                    is typically introduced after addition and subtraction. Multiplication can be represented visually using objects 
                    like grids or arrays, or using symbols like numbers and mathematical notation. It is used in everyday life for tasks like calculating 
                    the total cost of multiple items, determining the area of a rectangle, and solving basic word problems. In mathematics, multiplication is often 
                    used in conjunction with other operations like addition, subtraction, and division to solve more complex problems. It's also an essential skill for 
                    developing mathematical reasoning and problem-solving abilities.

                    <span class="heading"><u>The fourth lesson that wil be covered is division:</u></span><br>
                    Division is a fundamental mathematical operation that involves splitting a number into equal parts or groups. 
                    It is one of the basic arithmetic operations and is typically introduced after addition, subtraction, and multiplication. 
                    Division can be represented visually using objects like counters or blocks, or using symbols like numbers and mathematical notation. 
                    It is used in everyday life for tasks like dividing food among people, calculating rates and percentages, and solving basic word problems. 
                    In mathematics, division is often used in conjunction with other operations like addition, subtraction, and multiplication to solve more complex problems. 
                    It's also an essential skill for developing mathematical reasoning and problem-solving abilities.

                    <span class="heading"><u>The final lesson would be an about operation precedence</u></span><br>
                    Operation precedence is a rule that specifies the order in which mathematical operations are performed in an equation or expression. It determines which operation is performed first, second, and so on. The order of operations is:
                    <br><br>
                    1. Parentheses( Brackets are parentheses ): Perform the operations inside the parentheses first.<br>
                    2. Exponents: Perform any exponents (ie. powers and square roots) next.<br>
                    3. Multiplication and Division: Perform multiplication and division, from left to right.<br>
                    4. Addition and Subtraction: Perform addition and subtraction, from left to right.
                    <br><br>
                    This order of operations ensures that there is a consistent way to evaluate mathematical expressions and equations, regardless of who is doing the calculation or what calculator or software program is being used.
